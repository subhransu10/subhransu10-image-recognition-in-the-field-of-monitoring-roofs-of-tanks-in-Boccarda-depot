# A Digital Twin approach for inspection of floating roof storage tanks in Boccarda Depot with the help of UAVs
## In collaboration with IPLOM S.p.A
The Master Thesis is about monitoring and detecting the anomalies with the UAV in the Boccarda depot. The focus is on detecting the inclination of the roof of the floating roof storage tanks by using and thus ensuring that the structural integrity of the floating roof storage tank remains intact.

## TASKS
- Conducted comprehensive structural health monitoring of floating roof storage tanks in Boccarda depot at Iplom Oil refinery and validated the model with inclinometer and accelerometer data.
- Planned and executed testing and data collection activities on-site.
- Analyzed and interpreted data to ensure the integrity and safety of storage tanks.
- Prepared detailed technical documentation and reports on findings and recommendations from ENEA, Infosolution, and IPLOM.
- Developed and implemented Computer Vision (Object Detection) and Machine Learning (Deep CNN Image classifier) techniques for anomaly detection.
- Utilized digital twin technology and Unreal Engine for virtual environment simulation and process optimization.
- Autonomous Inspection: Ensured the autonomous movement of the drone in the environment and achieved desired tasks.

## STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING OF THE FLOATING ROOF STORAGE TANKS
- Finding the Objectives: To monitor the tank area of the Boccarda Depot
- Selection of monitoring techniques: With the help of accelerometer data, optical fibres, inclinometer
